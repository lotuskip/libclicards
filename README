libclicards is a simple C library that can be used for creating card games in
the console. It contains functionality to handle arbitrary decks of standard
playing cards along with NCurses based printing functions.

The library is, and is intended to be, extremely small&simple, not very
customizable other than by rewriting parts of it, while nonetheless quite
powerful, usable, and versatile.

No separate documentation is provided. The header file which you should be
including if you intend to use the library is well commented, and there are
illustrative example games provided.
